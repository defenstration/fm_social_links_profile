## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is the first project from Frontend Mentor that I didn't have the figma file for (haven't sign up for pro yet :), and I wanted to see how well I could eyeball the project. I think it came out pretty well.

The tools I used were basic HTML and CSS. I used Flexbox to do a lot of the positioning. I'm really happy using a reset and some basic utility classes. I hadn't worked with them until recently, but it's a much better experience getting into projects with that base to work from.

### Continued development

One more project in the intro learning path on Frontend Mentor!
